**Global Styles**

    This section applies to all elements on the page. It removes default browser padding and margin, and box-sizing: border-box ensures that padding and borders are included within an element's specified width and height, simplifying layout calculations.

**Body Styling**

    The body is set to take up the full height of the viewport (100vh) and has a blueviolet background. display: flex makes it a flex container, which is often used to easily center content within the body.

**Memory Game Container**

    This defines the main container for the memory game cards. It's a fixed-size square (640px by 640px) that's centered horizontally (margin: auto when display: flex is on the parent body). It's also a flex container that allows its items (.memory-card) to wrap to the next line, creating a grid-like layout. perspective: 1000px is crucial for 3D transformations, giving a sense of depth when cards flip.

**Memory Card Styling**

    This styles each individual memory card:

    Sizing and Spacing (d): Each card takes up roughly 25% of the width and 33.333% of the height of the .memory-game container, with 10px subtracted for margins. The margin: 5px creates spacing around each card.
    Positioning (c): position: relative is set so that its child elements (the front and back faces) can be absolutely positioned relative to the card itself.
    Initial State & Hover Effect (d): transform: scale(1) is the default size. When a card is :active (clicked or touched), it slightly shrinks (scale(0.97)) with a quick transition, providing visual feedback.
    3D Transformations (e 3d):
        transform-style: preserve-3d ensures that child elements (faces) participate in the 3D space.
        transition: transform .5s makes any transform changes (like flipping or scaling) happen smoothly over half a second.
    Flipping: When the .flip class is added (presumably by JavaScript), the card rotates 180 degrees around its Y-axis, creating the flip animation.

**Card Faces Styling**

    This styles the two sides of each card:

    Both faces take up 100% of the card's width and height and are position: absolute so they overlap exactly. They have padding, rounded corners, and a dark purple background.
    backface-visibility: hidden (f): This is crucial for the flip animation. It hides the back of an element when it's rotated away from the viewer. This means when the .front-face is showing, you don't see the .back-face peeking through the "backside" of the .front-face, and vice-versa.
    Initial Front Face Rotation (g): The .front-face is initially rotateY(180deg). This means it starts flipped over, so when the card itself is not flipped (transform: rotateY(0deg)), you see the .back-face. When the card is flipped (transform: rotateY(180deg)), the .front-face will rotate back into view.

    In Summary

    This CSS code sets up a responsive memory game layout using Flexbox for arrangement and sophisticated 3D transform properties (like rotateY, perspective, transform-style, and backface-visibility) to create smooth, realistic card-flipping animations. It handles the initial layout, spacing, and the visual feedback for clicking cards, preparing the stage for JavaScript to control the actual game logic and add/remove the .flip class.

    Initialization:
        cards: Selects all game cards.
        hasFlippedCard: false (no card is currently flipped, waiting for the first click).
        firstCard, secondCard: null (no cards selected yet).
        lockBoard: false (the board is not locked, allowing clicks).

    Shuffling (on load):
        (function shuffleCards(){...})();: This immediately shuffles the cards randomly on the board when the page loads by assigning order CSS property to each card.

    Event Listeners:
        cards.forEach(card => card.addEventListener('click', flipCard));: Each card is set up to call the flipCard function when clicked.

    First Card Click (flipCard function):
        A card is clicked.
        if(lockBoard) return;: Board is not locked, so it continues.
        if(this === firstCard) return;: This is the first click, so firstCard is null. It continues.
        this.classList.add('flip');: The clicked card gets the 'flip' CSS class, showing its face.
        if(!hasFlippedCard) is true (because hasFlippedCard is false).
            hasFlippedCard = true;: Now we know one card is flipped.
            firstCard = this;: The clicked card is stored as firstCard.
            return;: The function exits, waiting for the second click.

    Second Card Click (flipCard function):
        Another card is clicked.
        if(lockBoard) return;: Board is not locked, continues.
        if(this === firstCard) return;: If the user clicks the same card again, it returns. Assuming it's a different card, it continues.
        this.classList.add('flip');: The second clicked card also flips.
        if(!hasFlippedCard) is false (because it's now true from the first click).
        secondCard = this;: The newly clicked card is stored as secondCard.
        checkForMatch();: This function is called to see if the two cards match.

    Checking for Match (checkForMatch function):
        let isMatch = firstCard.dataset.framework === secondCard.dataset.framework;: Compares the data-framework attribute of the two flipped cards.
        isMatch ? disableCards() : unflipCards();:
            If isMatch is true (Match Found): disableCards() is called.
                firstCard.removeEventListener(...), secondCard.removeEventListener(...): The matched cards can no longer be clicked.
                resetBoard();: The board state is reset.
            If isMatch is false (No Match): unflipCards() is called.
                lockBoard = true;: The board is locked (prevents further clicks during the unflip animation).
                setTimeout(...): After 1.5 seconds:
                    firstCard.classList.remove('flip'), secondCard.classList.remove('flip'): Both cards flip back face down.
                    resetBoard();: The board state is reset.

    Resetting the Board (resetBoard function):
        [hasFlippedCard, lockBoard] = [false, false];: Resets these flags, preparing for the next pair of clicks.
        [firstCard, secondCard] = [null, null];: Clears the references to the previously flipped cards.

Value Shifting Summary:

    hasFlippedCard: Toggles between false (initial, after reset) and true (after the first card is flipped).
    firstCard, secondCard: Store references to the actual DOM elements of the flipped cards, then reset to null after a match or mismatch.
    lockBoard: true temporarily during the unflipCards() animation to prevent new clicks, then false after reset.
